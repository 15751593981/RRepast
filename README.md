# R/Repast  

Invoke and analyze 'Repast Simphony' Simulation Models 

## Description

An R and Repast integration tool for running individual-based
(IbM) simulation models developed using 'Repast Simphony' Agent-Based framework
directly from R code. This package integrates 'Repast Simphony' models within
R environment, making easier the tasks of running and analyzing model output
data for automated parameter calibration and for carrying out uncertainty and
sensitivity analysis using the power of R environment.
